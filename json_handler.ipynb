After recording their second album Earthquake Visions , they released three singles in conjunction with the record and toured through Europe in 1994 supporting Kingdom Come . Earthquake Visions eventually sold a disappointing 30,000 copies, despite being released in as many as 30 countries. More importantly though, Martin also began collaborating on songs with PoP. Recognizing a talent for writing pop songs in the young rocker, PoP renamed his new protégé Max Martin and eventually became Martin\\'s mentor.

[11] In 1993, Martin was hired by Cheiron Studios and spent some time learning the basics, before the first production collaboration between PoP and Martin: the Rednex song \" Wish You Were Here \" in 1994.

Jindal called the president\\'s economic stimulus plan \"irresponsible\" and argued against government intervention. [90] He used Hurricane Katrina to warn against government solutions to the economic crisis. \"Today in Washington, some are promising that government will rescue us from the economic storms raging all around us,\" Jindal said. \"Those of us who lived through Hurricane Katrina, we have our doubts.\" He praised the late sheriff Harry Lee for standing up to the government during Katrina. [91] [92] The speech met with biting reviews from some members of both the Democratic and the Republican parties. Referring to Jindal as \"devoid of substantive ideas for governing the country\", political commentator Rachel Maddow summarized Jindal\\'s Katrina remark as follows: \"[Jindal states that] since government failed during Hurricane Katrina, we should understand, not that government should not be allowed to fail again, but that government...never works. That government can\\'t work, and therefore we should stop seeking a functioning government.\" [93] David Johnson, a Republican political strategist criticized Jindal\\'s mention of Hurricane Katrina, stating \"The one thing Republicans want to forget is Katrina.\" [94] While Jindal\\'s speech was poorly received by several Democratic and Republican critics, others argued that the speech should be judged on substance rather than delivery style.

So, what exactly is a sweetbread? The answer is possibly less appetizing than you thought. Most mammals, including humans and cows, have a thymus, a gland that helps produce immune cells, such as T cells. Cows have more than one thymus, in their neck and by their heart. They’re only prominent in young cows, thus they are frequently referred to as “veal sweetbreads.” If someone says “beef sweetbreads” to you then they are either stupid, or are they are Bobby Flay trying to trick you into looking stupid. In either case you should hit them with the nearest mallet. Preparing sweetbreads involves removing the outer membrane by soaking them in salt water, usually overnight. They can then be poached, braised or straight-up deep fried. Like Lisa said on Top Chef last night, they’re kind of like a big beefy chicken nugget. Sweetbreads information on the internet seems to vary. Some sites insist that the pancreas is also a sweetbread; others say it is only the thymus. Many sites talk about whether lamb or pork sweetbreads are worth eating – lamb seems to be generally accepted. Explore the interwebs for more info; meanwhile, here’s Stephanie from Top Chef’s veal sweetbreads recipe .'},\n",

       "  'based_on_text': 'The thymus located in front of heart energy chakra, and in front of the physical heart, just under your sternum, is a specialized organ of the immune system. Within the thymus, T cells or T lymphocytes mature. T cells are critical to the adaptive immune system, where the body adapts specifically to foreign invaders. The heart chakra is closely woven into the endocrine system and Rose essential oil can be used to affect the hormonal balance of the body by triggering the glands into action or by balancing its hormonal secretion in some way. The thymus gland (essential for the immunological system of the body), works as a reflex centre for higher levels of consciousness. John ONeill suggests that this chakra is where “intent” originates, that it links the emotions of the heart with the reason of language.ONeill goes on to say “The Thymic chakra is where “intent” originates, it is the link between the emotions of the heart and the reason of language. It is what makes you inhale a breath before you speak, since this is where the intent behind the words you are about to speak actually starts forming. So, lets say that your heart feels a certain way about something that it would like to voice. The energy shoots up from the heart center to the Throat chakra but passes through the Thymic area first, giving it a heads up to start getting prepared to speak by drawing a breath – or by stopping the breath to prevent you from speaking. This is why you don’t always say what’s on the tip of your tongue. This is also why emotions can wreck havoc with your health, as the Thymic area of the heart chakra can be bombarded by emotions to the point of fatigue. The Rose EO calms the area. The Thymic chakra acts as something of a “lie detector” by interfering with energy that is not truthful. This is why we have trouble speaking when we are upset. The flow of energy from the heart is always meant to be peaceful and that’s really the only kind of energy that the Thymic area of the heart chakra “understands”) That is pretty much the looong story of why Rose and other essential oils can affect our chakra system of energies.'},\n",

All three processes involve the movement of lactate. 18 As stated previously, at physiological pH more than 99% of the lactic acid produced quickly dissociates into lactate (La − ) anions and protons (H + ). Lactate moves readily between cytoplasm and mitochondria, muscle and blood, blood and muscle, active and inactive muscle, glycolytic and oxidative muscle, blood and heart, blood and liver, and blood and skin. 20 Lactate moves between lactate-producing and lactate-consuming sites by means of intracellular and extracellular lactate shuttles. 18 Transport across cellular and mitochondrial membranes occurs by facilitated exchange down concentration and hydrogen ion (pH) gradients using lactate transport proteins known as monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). 20 As of 1999, nine monocarboxylate transporters had been reported in the literature. MCT1 is abundant in oxidative skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers and mitochondrial membranes. MCT4 is most prevalent in the cell membranes of glycolytic skeletal fibers. The intracellular lactate shuttle ( Figure 3-4, A ) involves the movement of lactate by MCT1 transporters between the cytoplasm, where it is produced, and the mitochondria. Once inside the mitochondria, lactate is oxidized to pyruvate and NAD + is reduced to NADH + H + . The pyruvate and NADH + H + proceed through aerobic metabolism/oxidation. This is a relatively new, and somewhat controversial, concept 20–23 indicating that muscle cells can both produce and consume lactate at the same time. Extracellular lactate shuttles act to move lactate among tissues ( Figure 3-4, B ). Muscle cell membrane lactate proteins (MCT1 and MCT4) move the lactate out of and into tissues. Intermuscularly, most lactate moves out of active fast-twitch glycolytic skeletal muscle cells (FOG and FG) and into active SO skeletal muscle cells. This can occur either by a direct shuttle between the skeletal muscle cells or through the circulation. Once lactate is in the bloodstream, it can also circulate to cardiac cells. During heavy exercise, lactate becomes the preferred fuel of the heart. In this manner glycogenolysis in one cell can supply fuel for another cell. In each case the ultimate fate of the lactate is oxidation to ATP, CO 2 , and H 2 O by aerobic metabolism. 13,20,24 Lactate circulating in the bloodstream can also be transported to the liver, where it is reconverted by the processes of gluconeogenesis/glyconeogenesis into glucose or glycogen, respectively. Indeed, the liver appears to preferentially make glycogen from lactate as opposed to glucose. In human glycolytic muscle fibers (both FOG and FG) some of the lactate produced during high-intensity exercise is retained, and in the postexercise recovery period it is reconverted to glycogen in that muscle cell. 4,25,26 Both oxidative and glycolytic fibers can also clear lactate by transamination. Transamination forms keto acids (including some Krebs cycle intermediates) and amino acids. The predominant amino acid produced is alanine. In turn, alanine can undergo gluconeogenesis in the liver. 13,14 A small amount of lactate in the circulation moves from the blood to the skin and exits the body in sweat. Finally, some lactate remains as lactate circulating in the blood. This comprises the resting lactate level. Oxidation is by far the predominant process of lactate clearance both during and after exercise. As stated previously, the accumulation of lactate in the blood depends on the relative rate of appearance (production) and disappearance (clearance), which in turn is directly related to the intensity and duration of the exercise being done.

Gruetter, in Encyclopedia of Neuroscience , 2009 Lactate Metabolism – An Integral Part of Normal Brain Function Brain lactate is present at near 1 μmol g −1 concentration under normoxic conditions in vivo , and is continuously synthesized and broken down. Glucose and glycogen are the major metabolic precursors for lactate, which can be exported and serve as fuel for other cells. A small lactate efflux from the brain is observed normally. Rapid but small increases in brain lactate are observed in focal activation, consistent with a transient uncoupling of oxygen and glucose metabolism. Similar to that for glucose, lactate diffusion behavior is restricted, indicating that most tissue lactate is intracellular. Lactate is almost evenly distributed in the brain’s aqueous phase, owing to the large transport capacity of the abundant monocarboxylate transporters at the neuronal and glial cell membranes.

Namasivayam Ambalavanan MBBS, MD, in Assisted Ventilation of the Neonate (Sixth Edition) , 2017 Lactate Lactate is not a traditional blood gas value. However lactate is routinely measured by many blood gas analyzers, so a brief basic discussion of its value is warranted. Analyzers equipped to measure lactate will directly measure the blood with a biosensor utilizing amperometric principles. 106 Lactate is the result of the metabolism of glucose during tissue hypoxia whereby lactate, ATP, and water are produced. 127 Tissue hypoxia and poor tissue perfusion can lead to hyperlactatemia, which can also result from other mechanisms. 128 Blood lactate levels are a reflection of the difference between production and elimination, with the liver being responsible for the majority of lactate clearance. 128 Normal blood lactate levels for the term infant depend on local established values and have been reported at <2.0 mmol/L. 129 Arterial, venous, and capillary values for lactate levels have been used clinically, with most reporting good correlation between the sample types. 127,130 Samples should be run within 15 minutes to prevent lactate levels from increasing prior to testing. 127 Lactate values have a useful role in the assessment of the newborn. Lactate measured in umbilical cord blood was shown to agree with pH and BE and has similar predictive value for short-term morbidities compared to pH and BE. 131 A retrospective study of term infants with intrapartum asphyxia comparing the predictive value of pH, base deficit, and lactate for the incidence of moderate to severe hypoxic encephalopathy (HIE) showed that the highest lactate levels in the first hours of life are important predictors of moderate to severe HIE. 127 Measurement of serum lactate is very helpful in differentiating increased acid production (e.g., due to inadequate tissue oxygen delivery) from loss of bicarbonate, such as occurs in renal tubular acidosis.

Bhagavan, Chung-Eun Ha, in Essentials of Medical Biochemistry , 2011 Lactic Acid Lactate synthesis is a “necessary evil.” In glycolysis, conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PD) requires reduction of NAD to NADH. The NAD pool is small, and without rapid oxidation of NADH back to NAD, glycolysis would quickly stop at the G3PD step. Extramitochondrial oxidation of NADH back to NAD is accomplished by conversion of pyruvate to lactate via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Since the maximal reported rates of appearance of lactate in blood are only one tenth the FG fiber production rate, it is clear that maximal production rate far exceeds the efflux capacity and that high-intensity exercise must necessarily produce high intramuscular lactate concentration. Intramuscular [lactate] as high as 45–50 mMol/kg of cell water have been reported in man. Intracellular pH in muscle fibers is about 7.0, and decreases 0.4 to 0.8 pH units during intense exercise. Lactate efflux from muscle occurs mainly by carrier-mediated lactate-proton cotransport and by simple diffusion of undissociated lactic acid . The former probably accounts for 50–90% of the lactate efflux, depending on fiber type and pH. There are three or more muscle lactate transporters. However, K m for lactate has not been found to differ significantly between fiber types, being around 30 mM. The high K m implies that a lot (perhaps most) of the lactate produced will be retained during exercise, regardless of fiber type. Retained lactate maintains an NAD/NADH ratio which stimulates oxidation, and ensures subsequent oxidation or gluconeogenesis in the muscle. The fate of the lactate produced is primarily oxidative (55–70%), with as much as 90% of the labeled carbon in tracer lactate showing up as CO 2 during active recovery from exercise. Lactate released from muscle enters exclusively oxidative tissues in which [lactate] is low (e.g., heart, diaphragm), is converted back to pyruvate and oxidized. Retained lactate is oxidized to generate the ATP needed to replenish phosphocreatine stores following exercise, and to restore normal distribution of Ca 2+ , Na + , and K + .

Fetal levels of lactate are higher than maternal levels. The placenta may be a source of lactate even when oxygen supplies are adequate. However, the placenta is also an important site for clearance of fetal lactate, especially in cases of fetal hypoxia. Lactate is transported across cell membranes by members of the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family (SLC16), which mediate H + –lactate co-transport. Both the MVM 170 and BM 170 efficiently transport lactate in the presence of a proton gradient. The predominant MCT isoform in the MVM is MCT4, whereas MCT1 is the main form in the BM. 170 It is believed that the primary route for placental elimination of metabolically produced protons by the fetus involves H + –lactate co-transport across the BM, followed by extrusion of protons in NHE-based exchange for sodium across the MVM ( Figure 39.11 ). It is also possible that excitatory amino acid transporters, which are active in the BM, 171 contribute to the transport of protons from the fetal compartment into the syncytiotrophoblast across the BM. These transporters mediate the cellular uptake of anionic amino acids, coupled to the co-transport of Na + and H + .

Irani, in Cerebrospinal Fluid in Clinical Practice , 2009 Lactate and Pyruvate l-Lactate is formed during normal anaerobic glycolysis by interconversion from pyruvate via the actions of LDH. Lactate levels in CSF largely reflect its production by the brain; early studies showed that even massively elevated blood levels had little short-term effect on the amount of lactate that could be measured in CSF. 163 More recently, however, monocarboxylate transporters have been identified that move lactate and pyruvate across cell membranes, including at the BBB and BCB. 164 Interest in CSF lactate levels has in part been nurtured by early studies showing high levels in bacterial meningitis, and to a lesser degree in malignant hypertension, cerebral hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, diabetes mellitus, and hypoglycemic coma. 1 CSF lactate levels also invariably rise in the setting of very low CSF glucose levels, as the brain is forced to increase its anaerobic glycolysis in order to meet its metabolic demands. The average lactate content of normal lumbar CSF is slightly higher than what is found in paired samples obtained from venous blood, 1, 163 which is itself slightly higher than arterial levels. Posner and Plum reported CSF lactate levels in normal subjects to be 1.58 ± 0.03 mmol/l, higher than arterial levels of 0.97 ± 0.13 mmol/l. 163 Zupping et al. reported CSF lactate levels in control subjects to be 2.03 ± 0.12 mmol/l, which again were higher than blood levels of 1.81 ± 0.14 mmol/l. 165 Overall, the consensus normal CSF lactate value derived from multiple studies ranges between 1.1 and 2.2 mmol/l. 1 The concentration of lactate relative to pyruvate (L/P ratio) in normal biological fluids is about 20:1, depending on local LDH activity. In the brain, this ratio may reflect the tissue redox state, because as cerebral glycolysis increases, not only do absolute lactate and pyruvate levels in the CSF increase, but the L/P ratio also rises. 166 In normal adults, Zupping et al. reported that CSF pyruvate was 0.079 ± 0.004 mmol/l, with an average L/P ratio of 17.6. 165 Another group of older control subjects showed values of 0.022 ± 0.007 mmol/l. 167 In a large cohort of hospitalized children whose workup for infection or metabolic disease was unremarkable and whose blood lactate levels were normal, total CSF lactate levels averaged 1.5 mmol/l (range, 0.6–2.2 mmol/l), mean pyruvate levels were 0.11 mmol/l (range, 0.059–0.212 mmol/l), and the mean L/P ratio was 13 (range, 7–23). 168 In young patients for whom CSF lactate and pyruvate is being measured to exclude an inborn error of metabolism, these authors proposed 90th percentile upper cutoff values of normal to be 1.8 mmol/l for lactate, 0.147 mmol/l (or 147 μmol/l) for pyruvate, and an L/P ratio of 17. 168 View chapter Purchase book Read full chapter URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416029083500133 ANTIOXIDANTS | Synthetic Antioxidants G. Ramis-Ramos, in Encyclopedia of Food Sciences and Nutrition (Second Edition) , 2003 Sodium and Potassium Lactates Lactic acid is present in many foods both naturally and as a product of in situ fermentation, as in sauerkraut, yogurt, and many other fermented foods. Lactic acid is also a principal metabolic intermediate in most living organisms. Sodium and potassium lactates are produced commercially by neutralization of natural or synthetic lactic acid (FDA 184.1768, 1639). Lactic acid to be used as a food additive can be obtained either by fermentation of carbohydrates or by a chemical procedure involving formation of lactonitrile from acetaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide and subsequent hydrolysis (FDA 184.1061). The microbiological and chemical procedures to obtain lactic acid are very competitive, with similar production costs. One method of biosynthesis in common use starts with glucose and produces pyruvate, which can be converted to both the l (+) and d (−) isomers using a stereospecific lactate dehydrogenase; however, only the l (+) form is produced commercially. The racemic mixture is always obtained by chemical synthesis. Synthetic lactic acid is free of the contaminants normally found in the product obtained by fermentation, and so it is completely colorless and probably more stable. Lactic acid and its salts are highly hygroscopic, and therefore are usually handled in concentrated solutions (60–80% by weight) rather than in solid form. These solutions are colorless and odorless, and have a mild saline taste.

Volpe, in Volpe\\'s Neurology of the Newborn (Sixth Edition) , 2018 Lactate Lactate as an important energy source in neonatal hypoglycemia was suggested by elegant experiments in the newborn dog. a Thus determinations of cerebral metabolic rates for oxygen, glucose, lactate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate were accomplished by measurements of CBF and cerebral arteriovenous differences of these compounds. 39 These data were then used to determine the relative proportions of cerebral energy requirements derived from glucose, lactate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate under conditions of normoglycemia and insulin-induced hypoglycemia ( Table 25.3 ). During normoglycemia, the newborn dog obtained 95% of its cerebral energy requirements from glucose and only a small fraction from lactate (4%) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (<1%). 39 With hypoglycemia, in concert with the expected decline in cerebral utilization of glucose, a striking increase in lactate use was observed (see Table 25.3 ). (No appreciable change in the contribution of ketone body utilization was noted.) In subsequent experiments, no significant decrease in brain high-energy phosphate levels occurred under these conditions. 65,67 Thus the data indicate that increased utilization of lactate spared brain energy levels under conditions of severe hypoglycemia . The mechanisms by which blood lactate leads to energy production in the brain probably include enhanced lactate uptake by the brain from blood and active oxidation to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase (see Fig. 25.5 ). Indeed, available data indicate that lactate uptake in newborn dogs occurs at a rate that exceeds that of adult dogs, even when arterial lactate concentrations are within or near the physiological range. b Concerning conversion of lactate to pyruvate, the activity of lactate dehydrogenase in the brain of the perinatal animal has been shown to be relatively high. 28,69-71 Moreover, other data suggest that the neonatal brain may have a particular ability to use lactate as a brain energy source as an adaptation to the relative lactic acidemia in the first hours and days after birth. 39,72 Lactic acidemia related to the hypoxic stress of normal vaginal delivery has been documented in newborn rats and lambs. 26,28,73,74 These data also bear on the relative resistance of the neonatal versus the adult brain to hypoglycemic injury (see later). The sparing role of lactate in neonatal hypoglycemia requires further elucidation, but the data from studies of the newborn dog suggest that this role is considerable.

Witkin, in Microbiome and Metabolome in Diagnosis, Therapy, and other Strategic Applications , 2019 Lactic Acid Lactic acid is the predominant acid in the vagina and responsible for the vaginal pH in most healthy women to be <4.5. The majority of the lactic acid comes from the anaerobic glycolysis of glycogen degradation products by Lactobacilli , as well as by other lactic acid–producing bacteria. The vaginal epithelial cells also release a relatively minor amount of lactic acid into the vaginal lumen. L. crispatus , L. gasseri , and L. jensenii each produce both the D and L isomeric form of lactic acid. In contrast, L. iners , other bacteria, and epithelial cells only produce the L isomer [4,25,26] . Unlike similar acidic compounds, lactic acid possesses unique immunological properties that downregulate proinflammatory immune responses. This has been most elucidated in the cancer literature, where production of lactic acid by tumors has been shown to decrease T lymphocyte activity, inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines, and induce macrophages to revert to an antiinflammatory phenotype (summarized in Ref. [27] ). It has also been demonstrated that lactic acid production by bacteria present in the gastrointestinal tract reduces local proinflammatory immunity [28] . It is, therefore, reasonable to project that lactic acid in the vagina similarly functions to diminish the magnitude and facilitate the resolution of inflammatory responses at this site that may be induced due to daily exposure to microorganisms and chemicals in the external environment. Especially during pregnancy, inflammation may interfere with the programmed series of events needed for fetal maturation, as well as induce a premature termination of gestation [5,29] . Thus, the ability of lactic acid to inhibit or kill potential microbial pathogens, while concomitantly blocking inflammation, highlights its utility as a key factor to promote successful pregnancy outcomes. Addition of D lactic acid by vaginal Lactobacilli further contributes to well-being. This isomer regulates the rate of lactic acid flow into and out of cells by modulating the activity of extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), an essential cofactor for monocarboxylate transporter activity [26] . As its name implies, EMMPRIN also induces production of metalloproteinase enzymes that degrade the cellular matrix and facilitate bacterial migration from the lower to the upper genital tract [26] . Thus, the regulation of EMMPRIN production by d -lactic acid facilitates epithelial cell survival in an acidic environment by preventing an intracellular acid buildup and by downregulating deleterious matrix metalloproteinase production.

McNeil, in Essential Emergency Medicine , 2007 Definition Lactic acid is a by‐product of glucose metabolism. Glucose is the food that drives energy production. Demands for energy increase with anything that causes an increase in basal metabolism: exercise, infection, disease, or toxins. Glucose is broken down into pyruvate and the pyruvate is further broken via aerobic and anaerobic pathways. Both take place simultaneously, and under normal circumstances a tremendous amount of lactate is created on a daily basis—15–25 mEq/kg/day, or roughly 1400 mEq/day for a 70‐kg man. Oxygen debt does not allow for the breakdown of pyruvate within the mitochondria in an aerobic manner, and there is a subsequent increase in pyruvate in the cytosol. This pyruvate is converted into lactic acid. Lactic acid is therefore a by‐product of energy production in the anaerobic state. Anything that upsets oxygen delivery to the cells upsets this fine balance because the aerobic pathway for pyruvate does not yield lactic acid. The same is true for any process that directly increases production or decreases uptake of lactic acid or reduces the amount of available HCO 3 − , the primary buffer that converts lactic acid to lactate. Lactic acidosis consequently leads to an increased anion gap. Lactic acidosis results when the body\\'s buffer systems are overwhelmed. This most often occurs when tissue oxygenation is inadequate either because of hypoperfusion or hypoxia. Hypoxia is far and away the leading cause of lactic acidosis. In the liver lactate is metabolized back to pyruvate, which is then converted into either CO 2 and water or glucose. Both of these processes result in the regeneration of the HCO 3 − lost in the initial buffering of lactic acid. This balancing act, which incorporates the breakdown of glucose (i.e., glycolysis) and the buildup of glucose (i.e., gluconeogenesis) under normal circumstances, leaves the serum lactate levels at approximately 1–2 mEq/L. The muscles, brain, skin, and RBCs produce most of the lactate in the body. In turn, lactate is extracted predominantly by the liver and, to a lesser extent, by the kidney. In hypoxic states, almost all tissues can release lactate. Even the liver can be converted into a producer of lactate. Historical classifications divide the types of lactic acidosis into two types: A (associated with clinical evidence of poor tissue perfusion) and B, which has three subtypes ( Table 8‐4 ). These classifications have a great deal of overlap and have given way to more recent classification systems that divide lactic acidosis into hypoxic nonhypoxic types and those resulting from increased production or decreased clearance. The findings of systemic hypoperfusion are not apparent in type B lactic acidosis. Among the mechanisms that may be involved is a toxin‐induced impairment of cellular metabolism or regional areas of ischemia. d ‐Lactic acidosis is a form of lactic acidosis that occurs in patients with short bowel syndrome, usually from jejunoileal bypass. Glucose and starch are usually metabolized in the small bowel but in the setting of short bowel syndrome are passed on to the colon where they are metabolized in part into d ‐lactic acid. d ‐lactate is not recognized by l ‐lactate dehydrogenase, the catalyst for the conversion of l ‐lactate back into pyruvate. So, d ‐lactic acidosis will persist much longer than A or B types. Furthermore, carbohydrate loading in these patients may result in CNS disturbances, chiefly altered mental status, slurred speech, ataxia, and weakness.

Here's a short(ish) explanation... As the name suggests the ATP-PC system consists of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PC). This energy system provides immediate energy through the breakdown of these stored high energy phosphates. If this energy system is 'fully stocked' it will provide energy for maximal intensity, short duration exercise for between10-15 seconds before it fatigues. Think of the ATP-PC system as the V8 of your energy systems – it provides you with the most 'power' because it produces ATP more quickly than any other system and because of this it fuels all very high intensity activities. It's downfall however is that it burns out very quickly. How does the ATP-PC system work? There are only a few steps involved in the ATP-PC which is why it provides energy so quickly. S teps of the ATP-PC system: 1. Initially ATP stored in the myosin cross-bridges (microscopic contractile parts of muscle) is broken down to release energy for muscle contraction. This leaves the by-products of ATP breakdown: adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and one single phosphate (Pi) all on its own.\"},\n",

[52] 2000–04: Scarecrow and retirement [ edit ] As his career flourished, Brooks seemed frustrated by the conflicts between career and family. He first talked of retiring from performing in 1992, and again in 1995, but each time returned to touring. [36] In 1999, Brooks appeared on The Nashville Network \\'s Crook & Chase program, again mentioning retirement in a more serious tone. [53] On October 26, 2000, Brooks officially announced his retirement from recording and performing. [54] Later that evening, Capitol Records noted Brooks\\' achievement of selling 100 million albums in the US, celebrating at Nashville\\'s Gaylord Entertainment Center . [55] Brooks\\' final album before retirement, Scarecrow , was released on November 13, 2001. The album did not match the sales levels of Brooks\\' heyday, but still sold well, reaching No. 1 on Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums charts. Although he staged a few performances for promotional purposes, Brooks stated that he would be retired from recording and performing at least until his youngest daughter finished high school.

[6] Intending for the song to be \"the height of simplicity\", [7] the songwriters drew much of its influence from Broadway music . [8] Due to Ashman\\'s failing health, some of Beauty and the Beast \\'s pre-production was relocated to a hotel in Fishkill, New York near Ashman\\'s residence to accommodate the ailing lyricist. [9] Out of all the songs he has written for Beauty and the Beast , Menken devoted the most time to the title song . [7] The track was first recorded by British-American actress Angela Lansbury , who voices the character Mrs. Potts , an enchanted teapot. The songwriters first introduced \"Beauty and the Beast\" to Lansbury as a demo recording , which was accompanied by a note asking her if she might possibly be interested in singing it. [10] Although a seasoned film and stage performer who had previously done her own singing for Disney in the musical film Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971), [11] Lansbury, who was more accustomed to performing uptempo songs, [12] was hesitant to record the ballad because of its unfamiliar rock style. [13] Although she liked the song, [14] Lansbury also worried that her aging singing voice was no longer strong enough to record \"Beauty and the Beast\", [15] and was especially concerned about having to sustain its longer notes. [16] Lansbury suggested that the songwriters ask someone else to sing \"Beauty and the Beast\", [17] but they insisted that she simply \"sing the song the way [she] envisioned it\". [13]'},\n",

[6] The comics landed him his first professional job writing for The Jenny McCarthy Show , a short-lived variety show starring Jenny McCarthy . Shortly thereafter, he was asked to submit a packet to the Late Show with David Letterman and was told Letterman responded favorably to animation. [6] After only nine months at Letterman , he was \"let go\" from the job. He recalled his stint on the program as unpleasant, noting that he did not have enough experience in writing.

In terms of comedy inspirations, it was SNL and Letterman and Steve Martin and Peter Sellers. Those were my big four.” 19. The Last Man producers’ greatest struggle with Forte might have been during a scene in the pilot when his character tries to walk across the bathroom full of empty water bottles and beer cans he’s been using to fill his toilet tank. Lord and Miller realized there were sharp objects throughout the pile and insisted he wear flip-flops, and Forte complained, arguing that the scene was going to be far funnier and more awkward if he went barefoot. “We said, ‘Look, I can’t have you go to the hospital and stop shooting. I know you don’t care if you, like, cut an important artery in your foot, but we’re going to lose our day if you do that,’” says Miller. Forte finally agreed. Then the minute the cameras rolled, he kicked off the flip-flops and did the scene barefoot anyway.'},\n",

Melavalavu in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, was declared a reserved panchayat for Dalits in the October 1996 local election. Dominant and upper castes did not take to this lightly and the elections could not be held. There was a second attempt to hold elections, but violence and booth capturing foiled it. Elections were eventually held on 30 December 1996. Upper castes boycotted it. Dalit candidates got elected to the president and vice-president posts, among others. Yet they weren’t allowed to enter the panchayat office by the dominant castes. On 30 June 1997, the president and vice-president, along with three others, were murdered in broad daylight. In a landmark judgement dated February 2001, the Allahabad High Court ruled: “The caste system in India, based on the feudal occupational division of labour in the past, is today totally outmoded and is a great hindrance to the nation’s progress...” This was in response to a case filed after a Dalit woman sarpanch lodged a police complaint after being harassed by the defeated upper caste candidates.

First, it must enable the dalits to send its true representatives to the legislatures. Second, dalits must not be completely isolated politically from the majority. Third, it must enable the dalits to influence the election of the members of the majority community to the legislature. Isolation, according to Ambedkar, was the worst thing that would happen to dalits, since no matter how large a representation was given to dalits, it was bound to remain a minority. It was very important for a minority that it should have among the members of the majority community, as many as it could have in the legislature, who would be under the obligation to stand up and support the cause of the dalits. He felt that the system of unqualified joint electorates served the second purpose but it enabled the majority to influence the election of the representatives of the dalits community, and thus disabled them for defending the interests of their oppression against the ‘tyranny of the majority’. The system, of unqualified separate electorates served the first purpose best but it defeated the second and the third purposes. According to him, the system he proposed served all the three purposes. Ambedkar wrote to the news agency stating that his one objection to Unqualified Separate Electorates was the existence of the British Imperialism, which, it was alleged, influenced the communities which had separate electorates to act against the interests of the country. With the end of British Imperialism it would be open to the Scheduled Castes to demand qualified separate electorates. The Scheduled Castes were however, prepared to accept the compromise scheme as just adequate for the purpose. But at the same time, Ambedkar adds, that this was the utmost limit of compromise they could go to. Following this, The National Standard of 3 February 1947 quoted a news item of the Free Press of India with a question mark: Ambedkar-Congress Agreement? It reported: ‘Agreement between the congress and Dr. Ambedkar, President of the All India Scheduled Castes Federation, on the question of representation to the Scheduled Castes in various legislative bodies, is likely to be reached soon, it is learnt here.

Bartoli won the first set in 30 minutes as Lisicki failed to cope with the occasion of a first Grand Slam final. The 23-year-old cut a fragile figure and was reduced to tears in the second set, helpless to prevent Bartoli from lifting the Venus Rosewater dish. Bartoli ended with an ace, collapsing to the ground once victory was hers. When the stunned 15th seed rose to her feet, she celebrated by climbing to the players\\' box to embrace family and friends. Among those whom Bartoli hugged was her mentor and 2006 Wimbledon champion Amelie Mauresmo, the last Frenchwoman to win at SW19, and her father and former coach Walter.

I was doing everything well. I was moving well, I was returning well. I really played a wonderful match. \"Even in my perfect dream I couldn\\'t have dreamed a perfect moment like that. That is beyond perfection.\" It was a final few had predicted and inexperience on such a grand stage perhaps explained the edgy opening from both finalists. The unconventional French number one surrendered the first game of the match with a double fault but her rival followed suit, double faulting to allow Bartoli to level at 1-1. Thereafter Bartoli, five years her opponent\\'s senior and seeded eight places higher than the German, settled the quicker, taking the second of two break points in the fourth game for a 3-1 lead. She had returned brilliantly throughout the Championships - making 81% of her returns prior to the final - and her ploy of returning from inside the baseline proved key to success over a big-serving rival known as \\'boom boom\\' in Germany. Her main weapon neutralised, Lisicki double faulted again in the sixth game before directing a forehand long to gift Bartoli a 5-1 advantage.

The German had opportunities in the second game of the second set but Bartoli held firm and a third Lisicki double fault gifted Bartoli three break points in the third, the Frenchwoman finishing it with an overhead at the net to move 2-1 up. And when another double fault presented her opponent with a break point in the fifth game, a clearly distressed Lisicki dissolved into tears. The German recovered herself but could not prevent Bartoli breaking to lead 4-1, and when the Frenchwoman held for 5-1 a rout seemed imminent. The seventh game duly brought two Championship points for Bartoli, but Lisicki not only held serve she then broke back, before another hold narrowed the gap to 5-4. If Bartoli was now feeling the pressure, she showed no sign as she served it out emphatically at the second attempt, concluding an impressive performance with her second ace of the match. \"Just to finish on an ace to win Wimbledon, you saw the chalk come out of the line...

       "  'based_on_text': 'Kennedy himself was said to have given copies of the album as Christmas gifts, and once greeted a Democratic National Committee group by saying, \"Vaughn Meader was busy tonight, so I came myself.\" [3] At one press conference, Kennedy was asked if the album had produced \"annoyment [ sic ] or enjoyment.\" He jokingly responded, \"I listened to Mr. Meader\\'s record and, frankly, I thought it sounded more like Teddy than it did me. So, now he\\'s annoyed.\" [4] Kennedy told Benjamin Bradlee that \"parts of it were amusing.\" [5] Other sources, such as Thomas C. Reeves\\' A Question of Character: A Life of John F. Kennedy , state that President Kennedy was upset with the parodies, and that First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was furious, even demanding that the President keep Meader off radio and television. Still in his 20s, Meader was suddenly famous, rich, and in constant demand. He was profiled in Time and Life magazines, appeared on network television variety shows such as The Ed Sullivan Show , The Jack Paar Program , The Andy Williams Show and Hootenanny . Though a series of tour dates in early 1963 were notably unsuccessful ( Billboard reported that he \"bombed\" in Pittsburgh, and only 742 people showed up in Philadelphia), [6] he still played to packed houses in Las Vegas . The First Family won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1963. That March, Meader recorded a follow-up album, The First Family Volume Two , a combination of spoken comedy and songs performed by actors and comedians portraying members of the President\\'s family and White House staff. The sequel was released in the spring of 1963, and while not as successful as the first volume, still sold hundreds of thousands of copies.'},\n",

Leonardo is the eldest brother, and leader of the group, quiet and the most serious of the four. He has a very close bond with Splinter, and has a strong sense of honor, ethics, and Bushidō . Leonardo\\'s twin swords are slung across his back. Episodes that deal with the Shredder and honor usually also focus on Leonardo, and he is often the Turtle who \"saves the day\". Leonardo is a more sensitive, self-doubting character than in previous incarnations. His younger brother Raphael often quarrels with him and resents his leadership, sarcastically calling Leonardo \"Fearless Leader\", although the two are shown to be very close at times. Though Leonardo\\'s relationships with his younger brothers Donatello and Michelangelo are not as volatile, both have made comments alluding to the high standards the former has set, and his tendency to make them look bad. Despite this, his brothers view him as a pillar of strength and are at a loss when he is injured or absent. One of Leonardo\\'s most prominent qualities is his determination to believe in the good and the best in people, even potential enemies; such as Karai .'},\n",

He is the one to usually take charge of the turtles when Master Splinter is not present. He is often at odds with his more hot-headed younger brother Raphael . In Leonardo #1, Leonardo goes out for a run on the rooftops of New York City and is ambushed by the Foot Clan . He puts up an admirable fight against an army of Foot Ninja, but is eventually overwhelmed. Beaten to near unconsciousness, he is thrown through April O\\'Neil \\'s apartment window.

In 2002, David Eick (whom Moore worked with on Good vs Evil ) approached Moore about a new four-hour Battlestar Galactica mini-series for Universal. Moore developed the mini-series with Eick, writing the scripts and updating the old series, also developing a back-story that could work for a regular weekly series should the mini-series be successful. At the same time, Moore was approached by HBO about running a new television series called Carnivàle ; however they decided to offer the position to Henry Bromell instead and offered Moore a consultant position on the writing staff. He accepted, but then Bromell left soon after production started and Moore became show runner . While Moore worked on the first year of Carnivàle , Eick ran the day-to-day production of the Galactica mini-series in Canada. Galactica aired in 2003 and became the highest-rated miniseries on cable that year [ citation needed ] and the best ratings that year for any show on Sci-Fi. [ citation needed ] After Carnivàle reached the end of its first season and the Sci-Fi Channel ordered a thirteen-episode weekly series of Galactica , Moore left Carnivàle to assume a full-time executive producer role on Galactica .'},\n",

He paid little attention at first, but after he reboarded the train the song remained with him and became so prominent in his mind that at the next stop, he left the train, took another train back to the earlier station, and asked the porter to sing the song again. Morris wrote down the words and music and published the song “Just a Closer Walk with Thee” that year, 1940, adding a few lyrics of his own to provide more breadth. Within two years the song became a standard in gospel music, eventually becoming a standard in Jazz, and then moving into the realm of American folk music, known and sung by many (Boyer, 75).” Songs with similar chorus lyrics were published in the 1800s, including \"Closer Walk with Thee\" with lyrics by Martha J. Lankton (a pseudonym for Fanny Crosby ) and music by William Kirkpatrick, which was published in 1885. [4] Some references in Atchison, Kansas , credit an African-American foundry worker and vocalist, Rev. Elijah Cluke (1907-1974), for the current rendition of the song. [5] \"Just a Closer Walk with Thee\" became better known nationally in the 1930s when African-American churches held huge musical conventions. [3] In 1940 Kenneth Morris arranged and published for the first time the well-known version after gospel musicians Robert Anderson and R.L. Knowles listened to William B. Hurse direct a performance of it in Kansas City and then brought it to Morris\\' attention. [6] Morris added some new lyrics and a choral arrangement. [6] In the 1940s, a boom of recordings recorded the number in many genres, ranging from Southern gospel to jazz and brass bands .'},\n",

[24] In the summer of 1912, Alma-Tadema was accompanied by his daughter Anna to Kaiserhof Spa, Wiesbaden , Germany where he was to undergo treatment for ulceration of the stomach. [25] He died there on 28 June 1912 at the age of seventy-six. He was buried in a crypt in St Paul's Cathedral in London. [25] Style [ edit ] Silver Favourites , 1903, oil on wood, 69.1 × 42.2 cm, Manchester Art Gallery . An example of Alma-Tadema's contrasting gleaming white marble against a backdrop of dazzling blue Mediterranean sea. [26] The artist obliterated the middle-ground, and the foreground is abruptly juxtaposed with the distant horizon, creating a dramatic effect. [27] Alma-Tadema's works are remarkable for the way in which flowers, textures and hard reflecting substances, like metals, pottery, and especially marble, are painted – indeed, his realistic depiction of marble led him to be called the 'marbellous painter'. His work shows much of the fine execution and brilliant colour of the old Dutch masters. By the human interest with which he imbues all his scenes from ancient life he brings them within the scope of modern feeling, and charms us with gentle sentiment and playfulness.\"},\n",

       "  'based_on_text': \"From early in his career, Alma-Tadema was particularly concerned with architectural accuracy, often including objects that he would see at museums – such as the British Museum in London – in his works. He also read many books and took many images from them. He amassed an enormous number of photographs from ancient sites in Italy, which he used for the most precise accuracy in the details of his compositions. Alma-Tadema was a perfectionist. He worked assiduously to make the most of his paintings, often repeatedly reworking parts of paintings before he found them satisfactory to his own high standards. One humorous story relates that one of his paintings was rejected and instead of keeping it, he gave the canvas to a maid who used it as her table cover. He was sensitive to every detail and architectural line of his paintings, as well as the settings he was depicting. For many of the objects in his paintings, he would depict what was in front of him, using fresh flowers imported from across the continent and even from Africa, rushing to finish the paintings before the flowers died. It was this commitment to veracity that earned him recognition but also caused many of his adversaries to take up arms against his almost encyclopaedic works. Alma-Tadema's work has been linked with that of European Symbolist painters. [28] As an artist of international reputation, he can be cited as an influence on European figures such as Gustav Klimt and Fernand Khnopff . [28] Both painters incorporate classical motifs into their works and use Alma-Tadema's unconventional compositional devices such as abrupt cut-off at the edge of the canvas. They, like Alma-Tadema, also employ coded imagery to convey meaning to their paintings. [28]\"},\n",

Alma-Tadema's female figures have a slightly bored pleasure-seeking attitude, as if they were pampered courtesans. [15] There is little action in Alma-Tadema's paintings. The composition is balanced by the flowers in bloom. After his arrival in England, where he was to spend the rest of his life, Alma-Tadema's career was one of continued success. He became one of the most famous and highly paid artists of his time, acknowledged and rewarded. By 1871 he had met and befriended most of the major Pre-Raphaelite painters and it was in part due to their influence that the artist brightened his palette, varied his hues, and lightened his brushwork. In 1872 Alma-Tadema organised his paintings into an identification system by including an opus number under his signature and assigning his earlier pictures numbers as well. Portrait of my sister, Artje , painted in 1851, is numbered opus I, while two months before his death he completed Preparations in the Coliseum , opus CCCCVIII. Such a system would make it difficult for fakes to be passed off as originals. [16] In 1873 Queen Victoria in Council by letters patent made Alma-Tadema and his wife what are now the last British Denizens (the legal process has theoretically not yet been abolished in the United Kingdom), with some limited special rights otherwise only accorded to and enjoyed by British subjects (what would now be called British citizens). The previous year he and his wife made a journey on the Continent that lasted five and a half months and took them through Brussels, Germany, and Italy. In Italy they were able to take in the ancient ruins again; this time he purchased several photographs, mostly of the ruins, which began his immense collection of folios with archival material sufficient for the documentation used in the completion of future paintings. In January 1876, he rented a studio in Rome. The family returned to London in April, visiting the Parisian Salon on their way back. In London he regularly met with fellow-artist Emil Fuchs .

       "  'based_on_text': 'Monty Python’s Flying Circus is a British surreal sketch comedy series created by and starring the comedy group Monty Python , consisting of Graham Chapman , John Cleese , Eric Idle , Terry Jones , Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam , aka the \"Pythons\". The first episode was recorded at the BBC on 7 September and premiered on 5 October 1969 on BBC1 , with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV. The series stands out for its use of absurd situations , mixed with risqué and innuendo-laden humour, sight gags and observational sketches without punchlines . Live action segments were broken up with animations by Gilliam, often merging with the live action to form segues . The overall format used for the series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his ground breaking series Q5 , rather than the traditional sketch show format. The Pythons play the majority of the series characters themselves, along with supporting cast members including Carol Cleveland (referred to by the team as the unofficial \"Seventh Python\"), Connie Booth (Cleese\\'s first wife), series producer Ian MacNaughton , Ian Davidson , musician Neil Innes , and Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers for musical numbers. [1] [2] The programme came about as the six Pythons, having met each other through university and in various radio and television programmes in the 1960s, sought to make a new sketch comedy show unlike anything else on British television at the time. Much of the humour in the series\\'s various episodes and sketches targets the idiosyncrasies of British life , especially that of professionals, as well as aspects of politics. Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual , with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures and their works. The team intended their humour to be impossible to categorise, and succeeded (although, by their perspective, failed) so completely that the adjective \" Pythonesque \" was invented to define it and, later, similar material. However, their humour was not always seen as appropriate for television by the BBC, leading to some censorship during the third series. Cleese left the show following that series, and the remaining Pythons completed a final shortened fourth season before ending the show.'},\n",

They are found in the cerebral cortex and brainstem and carry information down to activate interneurons and lower motor neurons , which in turn directly signal muscles to contract or relax. UMNs in the cerebral cortex are the main source of voluntary movement. They are the larger pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex. There is a type of giant pyramidal cell called Betz cells and are found just below the surface of the cerebral cortex within layer V of the primary motor cortex . The cell bodies of Betz cell neurons are the largest in the brain, approaching nearly 0.1mm in diameter . The primary motor cortex, or precentral gyrus , is one of the most important areas in the frontal lobe . The precentral gyrus is the most posterior gyrus of the frontal lobe and it lies anterior to the central sulcus . The pyramidal cells of the precentral gyrus are also called upper motor neurons. The fibers of the upper motor neurons project out of the precentral gyrus ending in the brainstem, where they will decussate (intersect) within the lower medulla oblongata to form the lateral corticospinal tract on each side of the spinal cord . The fibers that do not decussate will pass through the medulla and continue on to form the anterior corticospinal tracts. The upper motor neuron descends in the spinal cord to the level of the appropriate spinal nerve root. At this point, the upper motor neuron synapses with the lower motor neuron, each of whose axons innervate a fiber of skeletal muscle. [1] [2]'},\n",

However, throughout the early 20 th century, in an era before widespread access to education, Bryan was also known as one of the most famous Chautauquans. He delivered his popular “The Prince of Peace” lecture more than 3,000 times on the Chautauqua trail. Despite decades spent in the public eye as a political figure, being named one of the five greatest U.S. Senators of all time by a Senate Committee led by John F. Kennedy, and having a statue of his likeness displayed in U.S. Capitol, Bryan preferred the pulpit to the stump, educating to legislating. He saw himself more fit for the Chautauqua Circuit, where he spoke on virtue and spirituality, and educated audiences about political issues. In fact, while travelling the Chautauqua circuit, Bryan would introduce “The Prince of Peace” by stating, “the most important things in life lie outside of the realm of government” and “more depends upon what the individual does for himself than upon what the government does or can do for him.”'},\n",

(sometimes known as Sony Music or by the initials, SME) is an American music corporation managed and operated by Sony Corporation of America (SCA), a subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation. In 1929, the enterprise was first founded as American Record Corporation (ARC) and, in 1938, was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation, following ARC\\'s acquisition by CBS. In 1966, the company was reorganized to become CBS Records. In 1987, Sony Corporation of Japan bought the company, and in 1991, renamed it SME. It is the world\\'s second largest recorded music company, after Universal Music Group. \\n\\nIn 2004, SME and Bertelsmann Music Group merged as Sony BMG Music Entertainment. When Sony acquired BMG\\'s half of the conglomerate in 2008, Sony BMG reverted to the SME name. The buyout led to the dissolution of BMG, which then relaunched as BMG Rights Management. Out of the \"Big Three\" record companies, with Universal Music Group being the largest and Warner Music Group, SME is middle-sized.'},\n",
